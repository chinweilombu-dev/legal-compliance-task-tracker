A lightweight web-based application for tracking legal and compliance tasks, loosely inspired by the workflow and dashboard-style tools developed by OC Solutions in their "Operate" Track.



\## Features

\- Create, view, update and delete tasks (CRUD)

\- Task categorisation (e.g. Contracts, Data Protection)

\- Status tracking with overdue detection

\- Dashboard summary for visibility

\- Data persistence using browser localStorage



\## Tech Stack

\- HTML

\- CSS (Bootstrap)

\- Vanilla JavaScript



\## Design Approach

This project focuses on modelling a realistic legal/compliance workflow rather than over-engineering technical complexity. The goal was to explore how simple, transparent tools can improve visibility and control in regulated processes.



\## Future Improvements

\- Search and filtering

\- Pagination for scalability

\- User roles and permissions

\- Audit trail

\- Backend persistence (e.g. PostgreSQL or SupaBase Saas)
