A lightweight web-based application for tracking legal and compliance tasks, loosely inspired by the workflow and dashboard-style tools developed by OC Solutions in their "Operate" Track.

## Features

\- Create, view, update and delete tasks (CRUD)

\- Task categorisation (e.g. Contracts, Data Protection)

\- Status tracking with overdue detection

\- Dashboard summary for visibility

\- Data persistence using browser localStorage

\- Live-filtering search bar



## Use Cases

- Provides a **dashboard** for tracking legal and compliance tasks, deadlines, and status updates.
- Supports **process transparency** by replacing ad-hoc emails and spreadsheets with a clear, structured dashboard.
- Helps non-legal users **navigate regulated workflows** through simple task categorisation and status tracking.
- Improves **visibility and prioritisation** of time-sensitive obligations across teams.
- Demonstrates how **lightweight, user-focused technology** can enhance control and efficiency in regulated environments.




## Tech Stack

\- HTML

\- CSS (Bootstrap)

\- Vanilla JavaScript



## Design Approach

This project focuses on modelling a realistic legal/compliance workflow rather than over-engineering technical complexity. The goal was to explore how simple, transparent tools can improve visibility and control in regulated processes.



## Future Improvements

\- Search and filtering

\- Pagination for scalability

\- User roles and permissions

\- Audit trail

\- Backend persistence (e.g. PostgreSQL or SupaBase Saas)

\- Option to upload relevant documents/links alongside each task
